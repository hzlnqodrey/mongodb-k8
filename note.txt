1. Deployment file is going to repository/git/public, don't put ur secret in Deployment kind.

2. Order of creation is MATTERS! build secret first then Deployment

3. Service type: LoadBalancer
    -> assigns service an "external IP address" and so accepts external requests

4. Internal Service usually don't write the "type", the default is ClusterIP

5. The difference between ClusterIP and LoadBalancer type is:
    - ClusterIP doesnt give external IP address
    - but LoadBalancer does
